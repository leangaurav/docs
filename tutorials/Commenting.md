To see what useless comments looks like just search something like [*"youtube useless comments"*](https://www.google.com/search?q=youtube+useless+comments).  
**!! BEWARE:** Don't just get addicted and lost in the madness.


**TL;DR**
*Write a comment only if it's useful for the readers or maybe the creator. 
And there's no other way of passing the information apart from writing a comment.*


### When not to comment

1. If you have the urge to comment things like:
    - "Great tutorial"
    - "Worst tutorial"  
    
    There's a like and dislike button just to do that.

1. There's no comment already and you want to be the first one to comment.

1. New year has started.. and you want to be the first one to ask "who's listening in XXXX year"

1. There's a comment from the creator and you just want to reply. Since you read this thing but it didn't mention replying to comments explicitly.  

1. Replying to someone's comment just to make yourself look superior. (Being helpful and pointing people to right direction is sometimes better than being just humble).

and more stuff like that.

### When to comment
1. There's some mistake in the content.
1. Content has become outdated and needs to be updated.
